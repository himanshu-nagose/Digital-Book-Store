    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Our Journey So Far</h2>
        <p>
            Launched in 2025 as a university-level project, Online Bookstore quickly evolved into a full-scale platform driven by feedback, innovation, and a shared love for reading. What started with a handful of books and users has grown into a thriving ecosystem of thousands of titles and hundreds of daily visitors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our journey reflects dedication, adaptability, and the belief that access to knowledge should never be limited by physical or financial boundaries. With every passing month, we continue to grow â€” not just in numbers, but in the value we provide to our readers.
